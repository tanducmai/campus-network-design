# Project Vision

To design and implement a secure and efficient network infrastructure for a new
high school adjacent to Lot 14 in Adelaide CBD. This network should cater to the
various technological needs of the school while optimising for security and
cost-effectiveness.

# Features

1. **Network Infrastructure** - Develop a multi-building network that supports
   computers, printers, phones, and other devices.
2. **Equipment Selection** - Choose the appropriate networking equipment like
   switches and routers.
3. **Budget Management** - Ensure the project stays within the allotted budget
   of $860,000. This includes equipment, labour, and support costs.
4. **Security** - Design the network with optimal security measures to prevent
   unauthorised access and data breaches.
5. **Consultation Review** - Collaborate with an external networking consultant
   to validate the project's progress.
6. **Network Simulation** - Create a simulated model of the proposed network
   using Cisco Packet Tracer for validation and testing.

# Agile Roles

- **Product Owner**: Represents the client (the Principal) and communicates the
  school's needs and priorities.
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the agile process, ensuring obstacles are
  addressed and the team is productive.
- **Development Team**: Network designers, engineers, and any other
  professionals involved in the execution of the project.

# Sprints

The project will be divided into sprints, with each sprint aiming to achieve specific milestones:

1. **Sprint 0**:
   - Stakeholder Interviews & Requirements Gathering
   - Preliminary Network Design

2. **Sprint 1**:
   - Equipment Selection and Procurement Planning
   - Initial Security Measures Design

3. **Sprint 2**:
   - Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation Development
   - External Consultant's Preliminary Review

4. **Sprint 3**:
   - Network Implementation in One Building (Pilot Phase)
   - Feedback Gathering and Iteration
   - Complete Network Implementation Across All Buildings
   - Final Review by External Consultant
      - Fine-tuning, Documentation, and Handover
   - Post-implementation Support Planning

# Artefacts

1. **Product Backlog**: A prioritised list of features and requirements for the
   network.
2. **Sprint Backlog**: A list of tasks to be completed in the current sprint.
3. **Increment**: A usable version of the network at the end of each sprint.
4. **Burn-down Chart**: A visual representation of work remaining over time.

# Stakeholder Collaboration

Regular meetings will be scheduled with the Principal and any other relevant
stakeholders. Feedback loops will be established to ensure the product delivered
aligns with the school's needs.

# External Consultant

The external consultant will be involved in reviewing the progress, especially
the Cisco Packet Tracer simulations. Their expertise will be invaluable in
ensuring the network is robust and meets best practices.

# Feedback & Iterations

After each sprint, a review will be conducted to gather feedback and make
necessary changes. This iterative approach will ensure the end product meets the
highest quality standards and aligns with the school's requirements.
