According to the principal of the school:

1. The school has been asked to bid for a "school of the future" upgrade that
   would cover the cost of three transportables. Two of the transportables (T1
   and T2) would be computer pools each with 30 computers with web cameras. T3
   would be an advanced video capture studio with 10 computers and 2 4K camera
   streams outbound for video conferencing.
1. The principal asks the development team to:
    1. cost up the additional network requirements equipment requirements
       separately so that they can work this into the bid
    2. modify the network design to factor in these transportables as they are
       reasonably confident of their success in the bid.
1. The principal provides a map of the planned transportable location, which
   shows that they are located near the oval and the J building, and are about
   200 meters away from the G building.
